## Hi there , I'm Sandeep ðŸ˜¸
**`Student/Artist/Designer`**

I'm an indie developer with a keen interest in web development, data analysis, and game development. I'm currently focused on strengthening my foundation in core programming concepts. I'm eager to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers.

Beyond coding, I enjoy designing and creating digital art. I believe that a strong foundation in both technical and creative skills is essential for building exceptional products.
I'm always open to collaboration and learning new technologies. Let's connect!
